    "This Jupyter notebook was written to allow one to import data from an excel spreadsheet, similar to MailMerge in Microsoft Office.  Given that it is written in python, there is much more flexibility in what you would like to do, if you are accomplished in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this basic version an excel spreadsheet is imported that contains all information needed in the email (the email address is the only mandatory field).  In addition, an email template is read into the notebook along with the name of the file to be used as an attachment (if desired).\n",
    "\n",
    "To customize this mailer for your use, all that you need to do is make the appropriate changes in the _Settings Cell_.  More specifically, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Specify the name of the excel spreadsheet file in `excel_file` and define what the fields are that will be used in your template in `excel_columns`. In this version, there are four columns, `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Email`, and `Degree`.  The  `Email` field is __mandatory__, and it can appear in any column. You can change the contents, the order, and number of columns in `excel_columns`.\n",
    "2. Provide the name of the email template that will be mailed in `message_template_file'.\n",
    "3. Give the name of the file to be used as an attachment (if any) in `attachment_file'.  If no attachment, put _None_.\n",
    "3. Provide your outlook `username`, such as dr_python@gmu.edu, along with `your_name` such as _Monson Hayes_ that will be used in the FROM line of the email, and the email SUBJECT line in `email_subject`.\n",
